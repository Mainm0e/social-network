/*
NewManager is a function that creates a new Manager. This function doesn't take any
parameters and returns a pointer to a newly created Manager. It initializes all
the fields in the Manager struct - channels for broadcasting messages and
registering/unregistering clients, the client list, and the event handler map.
This function is typically called when the WebSocket server starts up and
needs to create a Manager to manage clients and messages.
